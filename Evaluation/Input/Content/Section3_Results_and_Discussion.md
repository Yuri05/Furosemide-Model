The PBPK model for furosemide was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data.

The model was built and evaluated covering data from studies including in particular

* single intravenous administration and both single and multiple oral administrations (solutions and tablets)
* a dose range of 1 to 80 mg

The model quantifies excretion via urine (by glomerular filtration and active transport mediated by OAT3 and MRP4) and metabolism via UGT1A9.

The next sections show:

1. the final model input parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#31-furosemide-final-input-parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#32-furosemide-diagnostics-plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#33-concentration-time-profiles).
